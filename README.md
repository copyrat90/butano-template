# Butano template

GBA gamedev template for [Butano engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano).

This template is meant to be used on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with [Native Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug) extension.

> This template is copied from [butano/template](https://github.com/GValiente/butano/tree/master/template), with my own tweaks.\
> It'll be better off just using the [official template](https://github.com/GValiente/butano/tree/master/template) that's always up-to-date,\
> and read this *README.md* as a guide to set it up with VSCode.

## Changing paths

You need to change some paths in this template so that they suit your environment.

1. Change `LIBBUTANO :=` on [Makefile](Makefile#L30) to your location for Butano.
